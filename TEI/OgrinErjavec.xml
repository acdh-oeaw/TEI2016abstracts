         <p>Even though early modern periods of 17th and esp. 18th century are important for the
            development of Slovenian literature, the manuscripts from these periods have only been
            given a sketchy treatment or did not enter the account of scholarly evidence at all.
            Recent research has proved, however, that many Slovenian Baroque manuscripts entail
            superior literary, cultural or spiritual values, but have never been published in the
            medium of printed books, because their authors continued – for several reasons – to rely
            on the manuscript culture as the main medium of their textual oeuvre.</p>
         <p>For this reason, new research initiatives have been undertaken for analysis,
            transcription, and digital processing of these texts. During the last 15 years
            (2001-2016), several TEI-conforming projects have been launched, which converged in
            three main methodological approaches.</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>The fundamental research is encompassed in the analysis of the manuscripts as
               primary sources, expressed in structured <gi>msDesc</gi> elements and arranged
               together online as the (beta version) Register of early modern Slovenian manuscripts
                  <note type="footnote"><ref target="http://ezb.ijs.si/nrss/">http://ezb.ijs.si/nrss/</ref></note>.</item>
            <item>Digital scholarly editions are an established route of text-critical study,
               processing, and presentation of selected early Slovenian texts in the eZISS
                  project<note type="footnote"><ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/index-en.html">http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/index-en.html</ref></note>, where one of the leading
               principles is our strict differentiation and inclusion of both diplomatic and
               critical editions of the text in question, which involves interesting issues of both
               encoding and on-screen processing.</item>
            <item>The third approach to the same text is still in progress: We try to find an
               optimized workflow to generate, for each edition, a lexicon of the words and word
               forms, extant in its text. Here, again, questions of diplomatic and critical word
               forms complicate the matter a lot, and we can observe – and aim to address – a range
               of normalizations, going to contemporary standard Slovene word forms and their
               lemmatization with part-of-speech tagging, as was demonstrated in the IMP
                  project<note type="footnote"><ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/imp/index-en.html">http://nl.ijs.si/imp/index-en.html</ref></note>. We are experimenting with
               various machine learning methods for the normalizations, concentrating on
               Character-based Statistical Machine Translation and Conditional Random Fields. The
               specific aim of the development of these methods is to facilitate the lexicography
               work, but could also prove useful in preparing new editions. During the preparation
               of a new edition, the training dataset for the translator between the diplomatic and
               critical words and sentences could be bootstrapped as the translation
               progresses.</item>
