            <p>TEI-encoded texts can serve easily as units of content for the purposes of text
               analysis, and may be up-coded easily with part-of-speech (PoS) data. For the present
               work, plays by Shakespeare and four of his contemporaries (James Shirley, Thomas
               Middleton, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson) were processed with Northwestern
               University’s MorphAdorner tool, developed by Philip Burns. XSLT, which is
               sometimes misunderstood as merely a display or rendering tool, but is also an
               excellent text analysis language, was employed to query all PoS-tagged data.
               Moreover, XSLT easily supports the development of custom statistical functions such
               as pooled standard deviation and Cohen’s d, functions helpful for comparing
               standardized differences between the separate data sets of the various authors. </p>
            <p>Experimental routines were then developed to examine speeches in each play for the
               intersection of two sorts of phenomena:</p>
            <list type="ordered"><item>parts of speech located at various locations within a word
                  n-gram sequence of a given length, and </item><item>content themes as identified by
               the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis framework. LIWC includes
               many content themes, but for this work, the author examined the following: Love,
               motion, body, anger, death, murder, and happiness.</item></list>
            <p>Once the XSLT query routines were developed, it became a fairly simple matter to ask
               questions such as these:</p>
            <p>Which author in the corpus wrote more 3-grams in which one of the words was a noun,
               and on the theme of happiness, or religion, etc.?</p>
            <p>How different is the occurrence of the religion theme in Shakespeare's 3-grams
               compared to Jonson's 3-grams, or Marlowe's with Jonson's?</p>
            <p>Which comparisons show the largest and smallest differences?</p>
            <p>Texts used here mainly originated in the work of the Text Creation Partnership.
               Martin Mueller offered additional WordHoard texts for this work.</p>
