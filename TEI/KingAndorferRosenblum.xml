         <p>This poster will present the first outcomes of an ongoing study that aims to address the
            extent to which digital scholarly editions (and in particular TEI encoded editions) are
            supported within member libraries of the Library Publishing Coalition. The sample
            includes more than 100 academic libraries, primarily in the United States as well as
            some around the world. This organization aims to promote innovative publishing services
            in these university libraries. Members therefore form a representative sample to address
            this question.</p>
         <p>Library-based publishing has become increasingly common among academic research
            libraries, as the Library Publishing Directory demonstrates. However, there are not
            clearly established organizational and service models for these publishing programs.
            Furthermore, while many of them are focused on scholarly journals, it is unclear how
            many of these programs are supporting the production and publication of digital
            scholarly editions making use of the TEI schema, nor is it clear what kinds of resources
            are required for them to support such efforts.</p>
         <p>The survey first aims to determine how many of these academic libraries understand
            digital scholarly editions to be those making use of the TEI schema and how many have
            other conceptions. The next objective is to elicit what kinds of support these libraries
            offer to digital editors including services, publication, preservation and access. Our
            final aim is to identify the success factors that motivate or enable libraries to offer
            support to editors and what the primary obstacles are which hinder support programs. The
            poster will discuss the initial results and trends of this survey and will give
            predictions about the findings and recommendations, addressing key issues affecting the
            publication, sustainability and access of TEI encoded editions.</p>
